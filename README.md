# AbleWebAssignment

Problem: Our partner companies like to hire trained talent from us but for a long time it was
done by sending resumes to companies via email. We have more than 50 companies now
who want to hire from us so we can’t send them resumes individually.

Our Solution: Let’s make a CRM for companies where they can post a job and we can
display a list of candidates to the companies.

Specifications: We will make a simple website where users can Log In/ Register and post a
job opening. Once it has been done we can view them using an internal tool.
For V1 of the Web Application we need a Login/ Register flow. Once it’s done, the user can
post a job in 2 simple steps as shown below.
